Welcome.
I like making websites, and I want this site to suffice for any kind of social media presence, so if you want to get to know me a little more, check out my ["now"](/now/) page.
If you _really_ want to get to know me, introduce yourself in an email addressed to <tristan@omg.lol>.

I also like tech, and I especially like helping others with their tech, so I'm looking for a job in IT support.
Please hire me!
You can view my qualifications on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trengel/).

Soon there'll be blog entries where I write about technical stuff that interests me.
Still working on my inaugural post, though.
Consider checking back in at a later time.
