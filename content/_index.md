Welcome. Thanks for stopping by. I'm an aspiring IT professional and hobbyist web developer. I'm currently looking for a job in IT support, but nevermind my telling you what I want to do for workâ€”that's what [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trengel/) is for. My hope is that this site will suffice for any other social media presence, so if you want to get to know me a little more, check out my ["now"](/now/) page. If you _really_ want to get to know me, you can email me at <tristan@omg.lol>. Otherwise, check out my blog posts below.
