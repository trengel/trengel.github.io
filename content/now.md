I'm slowly getting back into table tennis, something I haven't done since high school! There's a table tennis club in my area and it's been great so far.

## Reading

_[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0226458121)_ by Thomas Kuhn. The last book I finished was _[The Dog of the South](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781585679317)_ by Charles Portis.

## Playing

Nothing, just waiting for the [Metal Gear Solid Master Collection](https://www.dekudeals.com/items/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1) at this point.

## Listening to

The works of [Misha Panfilov](https://mpsc.bandcamp.com/). I'm normally not one to seek out jazz, but his music is so easy to groove to.
