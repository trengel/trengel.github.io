I'm slowly getting back into table tennis, something I haven't done since high school! There's a tennis club in my area and it's been great so far.

## Reading

_[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0226458121)_ by Thomas Kuhn. The last book I finished was _[The Dog of the South](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781585679317)_ by Charles Portis.

## Playing

_[Ruiner](https://www.dekudeals.com/collection/th9ntfh4tb)_

## Listening to

I've "rediscovered" [Booji Boys](https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/) after I straight-up forgot the name of the band. They kinda remind me of Royal Headache, but scuzzier. Good stuff. **Playing on repeat:** ["Goon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIxo8Sn-u2w) by Osees.
