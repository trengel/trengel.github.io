I'm slowly getting back into table tennis, something I haven't done since high school! There's a tennis club in my area and it's been great so far.

## Reading

_[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0226458121)_ by Thomas Kuhn. The last book I finished was _[The Dog of the South](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781585679317)_ by Charles Portis.

## Playing

_[Blasphemous 2](https://www.dekudeals.com/collection/th9ntfh4tb)_

## Listening to

Mainly ambient and drone music, which means relistening to the hours and hours of recordings by [Chihei Hatakeyama](https://chiheihatakeyama.bandcamp.com/) and [hakobune](https://hakobune.bandcamp.com/). I'll mix it up by listening to stuff like [Dead Ghosts](https://deadghosts.bandcamp.com/) and [Cool Ghouls](https://coolghouls420.bandcamp.com/music) sometimes. **Playing on repeat:** ["Goon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xj8_Sva1XM) by Osees.
